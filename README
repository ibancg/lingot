Description
===========

lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and
highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars,
its configurability gives it a more general character. (Tuning another
instruments has not been tested).

It simulates the appearance of an analogic tuner, with a gauge
indicating the deviation relative to a certain note --found
automatically as the closest note to the estimated frequency--,
indicating that note and its frequency.

The note will be found automatically, since the program hasn't any
manual function mode (indicating the note to tune manually), for
mantaining generality.

We recommend using the tuner in conjunction with a mixer for selecting
the desired recording source and the signal recording levels.


Requisites
==========

	* Sound card.
	* Kernel linux with audio support (OSS).
	* GTK+ library, version 2.0.
	
Installation
============

	Please, see the INSTALL file.

Synopsis
========

	lingot [-c config]

The -c option causes the search of a file named {config}.conf in the
~/.lingot folder. For example:

	lingot -c bass.conf

will take the configuration in the ~/.lingot/bass.conf file. This is
useful for maintaining different configurations for different
instruments.
